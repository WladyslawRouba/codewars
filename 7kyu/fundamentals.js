/*For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)
Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)
Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

In the drawing below we have a part of the Pascal's triangle, horizontal lines are numbered from zero (top).

We want to calculate the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients on a given horizontal line with a function called easyline (or easyLine or easy-line).

Can you write a program which calculate easyline(n) where n is the horizontal line number?

The function will take n (with: n>= 0) as parameter and will return the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients on line n.

Examples:
easyline(0) => 1
easyline(1) => 2
easyline(4) => 70
easyline(50) => 100891344545564193334812497256
